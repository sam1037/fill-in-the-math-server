**Joining a game**  
Upon being greeted by the lobby, you can choose to either "Quick Join", "Host Game", or "Join Game". The first option
is the quickest way to hop into a random game, the second and third option is for playing with friends, where you can
either host a game for you or your friends or join a game your friend is hosting via entering the room code.


**Objective**  
The objective of the game is to be the last man standing.  

**Puzzles**  
The way to become the last man standing is by completing arithmetic puzzles where the blanks must be filled in with the number pad without repetition.  

**Attacking and defending**  
Upon completing arithmetic puzzles, you can heal yourself by extending your timer, or attacking other players by diminishing theirs.  

**Health**  
A players health diminishes as steadily as time goes on, and can only be further depleted by attacks from other players or replenished via self-healing.  

**Winning**  
A game is won when all other players are eliminated (health dropped to 0).

Good Luck, Have Fun!
